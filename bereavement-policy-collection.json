Additional counseling should be coordinated through your medical insurance plan. Leaves of Absence A leave of absence is a way for team members who are experiencing out-of-the-ordinary circumstances to take time off work. Common reasons are childbirth, adoption, caring for an ill family member, serious health conditions or military leave.
